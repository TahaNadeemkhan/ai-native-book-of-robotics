# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+, TypeScript
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3, React, Better-Auth, Neon Serverless Postgres, OpenAI Agents SDK, Qdrant Cloud, FastAPI
**Storage**: Neon Serverless Postgres (with RLS via `tenant_id`)
**Testing**: [e.g., Playwright, Vitest, pytest or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Target Platform**: Web (Docusaurus) / Server (FastAPI)
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95 for API, <1s FCP for UI or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: Dark mode only, specific font/color palette, multi-tenancy enforced, SDD workflow
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., thousands of lessons, 10k users, multiple organizations or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
