## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

### Learning Outcomes
* Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
* Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
* Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
* Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
* Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
* Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
